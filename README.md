**Lecturer:** Artur Ekert


## Lecture notes

The notes for this course are, if anything, overly complete, and so the intention is not for you to blindly memorise them all by rote.
A sort of "Lecture 0" is found in the introduction, which covers most of the prerequisite material that will be necessary for this course.
There are additional exercises throughout the notes --- some of these will be repeated in the problem sheets, and some will not.
For the classes, you are only expected to hand in the problem sheets, but if you would like to do additional exercises when it comes to revision, then we might discuss some in a revision class in Trinity term.

The lecture notes are hosted at [thosgood.com/quantum-info/book](https://thosgood.com/quantum-info/book/), but are still mildly incomplete in some sections.
However, all of the sections that are not yet finished are simply supplementary material (apart from Chapter 11, which is on the syllabus, and should be finished long before we get to that part of the course), and thus not really necessary when you are following this course.

## Q&A chat room

There is a chat room for this course, which can be accessed [via this link](https://matrix.to/#/!BfkFjlYcdNLkPKHmrm:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) using any Matrix client, such as [Element](https://element.io/get-started) (which is free, open-source, etc. etc.), or even simply your web browser.
Myself (Tim) and maybe some other TAs/tutors will be in the room, but you should feel free to use it to talk amongst yourselves as well.
If there is enough demand for it, every so often I will collect together any questions that remain unanswered and send them along to Artur, who can then make a short video responding to them, as a sort of "on-demand lecture".

Basically, this year has been very tough for everybody, and has hit students particularly hard.
Because of this, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask for help.
You can email me at any time at [tim.hosgood@posteo.net](mailto:tim.hosgood@posteo.net).
