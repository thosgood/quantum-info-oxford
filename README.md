**Lecturer:** Artur Ekert


## Lecture notes

[**Click here for the online lecture notes.**](https://thosgood.com/quantum-info/book/)

The notes for this course are, if anything, overly complete, and so the intention is not for you to blindly memorise them all by rote.
A sort of "Lecture 0" is found in the introduction, which covers most of the prerequisite material that will be necessary for this course.
There are additional exercises throughout the notes --- some of these will be repeated in the problem sheets, and some will not.
For the classes, you are only expected to hand in the problem sheets, but if you would like to do additional exercises when it comes to revision, then we might discuss some in a revision class in Trinity term.

The lecture notes are still mildly incomplete in some sections.
However, all of the sections that are not yet finished are simply supplementary material (apart from Chapter 11, which is on the syllabus, and should be finished long before we get to that part of the course), and thus not really necessary when you are following this course.

Artur is also making some nice big one-page summaries of each lecture, and those can be found [here](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1Ub5hlpqwZpDsb5O_mOAuMqomY8_DOPYX1Q2lSfJh_Os/viewer?ts=600aa138).

## Lecture videos

The lectures are split into small chunks, to hopefully make them slightly less weary to watch (and easier to navigate).
All videos can be found [on Panopto](https://ox.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?embedded=1#folderID=%2233674f97-4292-4581-a880-ac3e00f7acc7%22) or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH).


## Q&A chat room

The class tutors will all be in the [Microsoft Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19:a30b2e33f28f4b728afc264b317978ac@thread.tacv2/C7.4%20Introduction%20to%20Quantum%20Information?groupId=0b19fb03-c6c6-4421-9bd3-06fc31b4213e&tenantId=cc95de1b-97f5-4f93-b4ba-fe68b852cf91), but you should feel free to use it to talk amongst yourselves as well.
If there is enough demand for it, every so often we will collect together any questions that remain unanswered and send them along to Artur, who can then make a short video responding to them, as a sort of "on-demand lecture".

Basically, this year has been very tough for everybody, and has hit students particularly hard.
Because of this, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask for help.
